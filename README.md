## Description

<p align="justify">
YAFRA is a semi-automated framework for analysing and representing reports about IT security incidents. Users can provide reports as PDF and YAFRA will extract IOCs (indicators of compromise). After extraction these IOCs will be enriched by external sources such as VirusTotal or MITRE in order to provide more context.
